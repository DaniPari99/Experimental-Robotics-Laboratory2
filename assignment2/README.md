The assignment involves a robot deployed in an indoor environment for surveillance purposes. The robotâ€™s objective is to visit the different locations and stay there for some times. The assignment is the logical continuation of the previous one (look [here](https://github.com/DaniPari99/Experimental-Robotics-Laboratory/tree/main/assignment_1)). Now the objective is the same, but the previous software architecture must be integrated with the new one in order to actually move an urdf robot model in a simulation environment.
The assignment can be divided in 2 parts:
* **Detect the all 7 markers:** initially the robot is fixed in a location in which is plenty of 7 markers in all the directions. The markers must be all detected in order to provide environment informations to the robot for creating the topological map of the environment.
* **Navigation in the environment** Once all the 7 markers are detected and the topological map is built, the robot is ready to navigate in the environment through the locations in order to patrol the whole environment area 

## Software architecture
The following figure shows the software architecture of the assignment:

As we can see we have 5 nodes, but there is a sixth file: the ```helper.py``` which is not in the figure, because it is not a node, but only a simple python file usefull for the ```assignment_fsm.py``` node.

* **assignment_fsm**: is the node which implements the Finite State Machine which drives the robot through the locations of the map according to the stimuli. It uses external functions provided by the ```helper.py``` node.
* **battery_state**: is the node which simulates the battery behaviour. The battery is recharged in a randome time belonging to the range [40, 60] seconds and run out in a random time belonging to the range [180, 240] seconds. This node publishes on the topic ```/state/battery_low``` the state of the battery: it is a boolean which is **True** if the battery is low and **False** otherwise.
* **armor:** is a server already implemented which is used by the ```assignment_fsm``` through the ```helper``` node for doing manipulations or queries on the ontology.
